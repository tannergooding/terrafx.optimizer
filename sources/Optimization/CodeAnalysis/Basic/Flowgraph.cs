        // This is essentially a depth-first traversal of the blocks that dynamically
        // adds the parents, children, and instructions during the traversal. We use
        // a stack-based algorithm to track pending blocks, rather than using recursion,
        // so that we can process much more complex methods.

        // We have two maps that are used to track the internal state of the graph:
        //  * instructionMap: Contains a map of every instruction to the block it belongs to
        //  * firstInstructionMap: Contains a map of the first instruction for each block

        // For each non-branching instruction, we just add the next instruction to the block
        // currently being processed. But only after checking if it is the first instruction
        // of another block (any other instruction should not have been processed yet). When it
        // is the first instruction of another block, we add that block as a child of the current
        // block and move to process the next block in the stack.

        // When we reach a branching instruction we create a new block for each of the target
        // instruction(s) and push them onto the stack. Like with the non-branching instructions,
        // we check if it is the first instruction of existing block and similarly add it as a child
        // of the current block. We then move to process the other target instruction(s) for the
        // branch before finally moving to process the next block in the stack. Additionally, for
        // a block that is not already the first instruction of another block, we check if it has
        // been processed already. If so, we then move that instruction, and any subsequent
        // instructions from the existing block to a new block and make the new block a child
        // of the existing block. We finally move all children of the existing block to be children
